## Kristopher Watts
### Front End Web Developer

Hello there! My name is Kristopher Watts, and I am a self taught web developer. So far, I have only worked for small freelance jobs for startups and a few companies looking to revamp their online presence.

## What Can I Bring to The Table?

Although I'm still learning and relatively new to web development and programming as a whole, I have an eagerness to learn and a passion for developing webapps that are creative, fun, and useful. My dream is to extend my current skillset by joining a reputable company and learning from experts already in the industry.
